## Benchmark results
* __Benchmark.xlsx__ <br>
The comparison between our methods for identifying self-targeting events 
and the methods developed by Stern et al. on the benchmark dataset of 330 organisms from CRISPRdb.


## CRISPRCasdb results

### Organism level statistics:
* __CRISPRCasdb_organisms.txt__ <br>
This file contained the number of spacers and the number of self-targeting spacers found in the organisms of interest.

### Spacer level statistics:
* __CRISPRCasdb_spacers.zip__ <br>
This zip archive contains only one file as a way to compress CRISPRCasdb_spacer.txt (~39 Mb) that includes information about spacers found in a given organism for all the organisms of interest combined. It also includes information about spacer length, whether a spacer is located on a plasmid, and whether the CRISPR array bearing a spacer is functional (whether it is accompanied by at least one cluster of Cas genes).

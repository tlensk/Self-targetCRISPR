To run the analysis on the test example, one can run the following command in the current directory (Code folder):

`python3 Find_ST.py test_example`

To run the analysis on the organisms of interest, one should supply a data directory for these organisms that contains necessary input files and resembles the organizational structure shown in the test example. The script (Find_ST.py) should be placed in the same directory where the data directory is located. To run the analysis, pass the name of the data directory as an argument. For example, if a data directory is called _mydata_ then one can run the following command: `python3 Find_ST.py mydata` in the directory that contains both _mydata_ and the script. 

_Alternatively, one can place the script inside a data directory (it should be placed next to list.txt) and run the script without an argument._
